## 2024-05-09 - Memoize Dexie live query derived values
**Learning:** In React components using Dexie.js `useLiveQuery`, derived data structures from query arrays (e.g. `Object.fromEntries(dbSettings.map(...))`) create new object references on every render. Because `useLiveQuery` re-evaluates frequently or whenever the database changes, these new references cause expensive, cascading re-renders in child components.
**Action:** Always wrap data derived from `useLiveQuery` results (like `.map`, `.filter`, or `Object.fromEntries`) with `useMemo` using the raw live query results as the dependency array.
## 2026-05-22 - Dexie array derivations
**Learning:** The same pattern from the 2024-05-09 entry (Dexie live queries returning raw arrays that get transformed into derived objects causing cascading re-renders) also affects array filtering and mapping operations like `.filter()` and `.map()`.
**Action:** Wrap all complex array derivations off of `useLiveQuery` arrays in `useMemo`.
## 2025-02-12 - Prevent Expensive Re-renders with useMemo
**Learning:** In React components with frequent state updates (like Dashboard.tsx ticking a timer every second), inline array derivations (`.filter()`, `.sort()`) cause expensive O(n log n) recalculations and violate React's referential equality principles.
**Action:** Always extract array derivations into `useMemo` hooks when dealing with frequently re-rendering components to prevent stuttering and CPU waste.
